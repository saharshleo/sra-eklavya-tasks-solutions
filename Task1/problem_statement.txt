Given data contains the values obtained by a line sensor.
4 space separated values on each line gives the values of sensor at any instant

You have been given a scenario of a white line on black surface
there are regions on this line called nodes

A node looks like this

        |
        |
    ____|____   <-- node here
        |
        |
        |
        |
        |

        ^
        |   bot travels in this direction

Your task is to count the number of nodes from the values given in data
            
The bot starts "On the line", "passes straight through nodes"
and stops when it reaches the "end of line"

This is a practically obtained data set
so discard any impractical values which may have been recorded
due to "sensor or motion errors"
