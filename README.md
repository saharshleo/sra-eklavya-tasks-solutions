## Task 3  
Given a lidar data in bin file, find the distance and strength readings and plot the same.  
Detailed problem statement can be found [here](https://sra-vjti.github.io/eklavya2020-assignments/assignment_3.html).

    gcc solution_3.c  
    ./a.out  
    
    gnuplot  
    gnuplot> plot "./distance.txt" using 1:2 with linespoints  
    gnuplot> plot "./signal.txt " using 1:2 with linespoints  
    
**Output**  

    Enter the filename: data.bin
    Reading, Distance, Strength
