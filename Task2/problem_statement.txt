Given data contains the values obtained by a line sensor.
4 space separated values on each line gives the values of sensor at any instant

You have been given a scenario of a white line on black surface
there are regions on this line called nodes
there are turns at 90 degrees that bot has to take

A turn looks like this


        _____   <-- turn here    
        |
        |
    ____|____   <-- node here
        |
        |
        |
        |
        |

        ^
        |   bot travels in this direction

The direction in which bot faces at start is NORTH

We encode the direction as
NORTH   0
EAST    1
SOUTH   2
WEST    3


Your task is to count the number of nodes, number of turns
and the direction bot faces at the end

The bot starts "On the line", "passes straight through nodes",
"turns left or right at turns" and stops when it reaches the "end of line"

This is a practically obtained data set
so discard any impractical values which may have been recorded
due to "sensor, motion and sharp turn errors"
