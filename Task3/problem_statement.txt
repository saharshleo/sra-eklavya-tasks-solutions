You have been given a 1D lidar sensor data.
Go through its datasheet provided within this folder
Especially the "Serial port data communication" part

In the file data.bin
you have been given a large set of binary stream received from the lidar.
Each data stream has been seperated by a \x0A (newline byte)
Extract the distance and signal info and plot a graph for both

This is a practically obtained data set
so discard any impractical values which may have been recorded
refer the datasheet to know what impractical means for this lidar
